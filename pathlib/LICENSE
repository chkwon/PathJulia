The PATH license can be set either in an environment variable called
PATH_LICENSE_STRING or programatically with the Path_SetLicense()
function.  For example, 

  setenv PATH_LICENSE_STRING "3414366176&Evaluation&&&USR&1001&5_9_2003&1000&PATH&GEN&31_12_2003&0_0_0&0&0_0"

will set the PATH_LICENSE_STRING environment variable on a Solaris or
Linux system to the evaluation license.  Alternatively, in your interface 
code, you can set the license with the following function call

  License_SetString("3414366176&Evaluation&&&USR&1001&5_9_2003&1000&PATH&GEN&31_12_2003&0_0_0&0&0_0");

which, if used, must be issued before a call to Path_Solve() or any other
license management functions.

The above evaluation will allow you to solve problems of any size
until December 31, 2003.  After that time, you will revert to a demonstration
license which only solves problems with up to 300 variables and 2000 
nonzeros.  Please contact either Michael Ferris (ferris@cs.wisc.edu) or
Todd Munson (tmunson@mcs.anl.gov) for information on obtaining an 
unrestricted license.
